# OpenCode plugin for Obsidian


Give your notes AI capability by embedding Opencode [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) AI assistant directly in Obsidian:

**Use cases:**
- Summarize and distill long-form content
- Draft, edit, and refine your writing
- Query and explore your knowledge base
- Generate outlines and structured notes

This plugin uses OpenCode's web view that can be embedded directly into Obsidian window. Usually similar plugins would use the ACP protocol, but I want to see how how much is possible without having to implement (and manage) a custom chat UI - I want the full power of OpenCode in my Obsidian.

_Note: plugin author is not afiliated with OpenCode or Obsidian - this is a 3rd party software._

## Requirements

- Desktop only (uses Node.js child processes)
- [OpenCode CLI](https://opencode.ai) installed 
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed

## Installation

### For Users (BRAT - Recommended for Beta Testing)

The easiest way to install this plugin during beta is via [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) (Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool):

1. Install the BRAT plugin from Obsidian Community Plugins
2. Open BRAT settings and click "Add Beta plugin"
3. Enter: `mtymek/opencode-obsidian`
4. Click "Add Plugin" - BRAT will install the latest release automatically
5. Enable the OpenCode plugin in Obsidian Settings > Community Plugins

BRAT will automatically check for updates and notify you when new versions are available.

### For Developers

If you want to contribute or develop the plugin:

1. Clone to `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-opencode` subdirectory under your vault's root:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mtymek/opencode-obsidian.git .obsidian/plugins/obsidian-opencode
   ```
2. Install dependencies and build:
   ```bash
   bun install && bun run build
   ```
3. Enable in Obsidian Settings > Community Plugins
4. Add AGENTS.md to your workspace root to guide the AI assistant

## Usage

- Click the terminal icon in the ribbon, or
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+O` to toggle the panel
- Server starts automatically when you open the panel

## Context injection (experimental)

This plugin can automatically inject context to the running OC instance: list of open notes and currently selected text.

It can be configured form the plugin settings.

Currently, this is work-in-progress feature with some limitations:
- It won't work when creating new session from OC interface.

## Troubleshooting

### Linux: OpenCode executable not found

If you encounter "Executable not found" errors on Linux, the plugin will automatically check common npm installation paths:
- `/usr/lib/node_modules/opencode-ai/node_modules/opencode-linux-x64/bin/opencode`
- `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/opencode-ai/node_modules/opencode-linux-x64/bin/opencode`
- `~/.npm-global/lib/node_modules/opencode-ai/node_modules/opencode-linux-x64/bin/opencode`
- `~/.local/lib/node_modules/opencode-ai/node_modules/opencode-linux-x64/bin/opencode`

You can also manually set the full path in plugin settings under "OpenCode path".

To find your OpenCode installation:
```bash
# If installed globally via npm
npm list -g opencode-ai

# Check the actual binary location
ls -la /usr/lib/node_modules/opencode-ai/node_modules/opencode-linux-x64/bin/opencode
```

## Releases

This plugin uses automated GitHub releases. Once the first version is tagged using `bun run version:patch` (or minor/major), all future releases will be created automatically when version tags are pushed to the repository. 

Releases are marked as "pre-release" to work with BRAT (Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool) for automatic updates. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed release instructions.
